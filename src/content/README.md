# Content Editing Map

Edit these files to change text and content without digging through long component files:

- `src/content/projects.js` — project cards + modal copy (titles, descriptions, tech, links)
- `src/content/services.js` — capabilities list + services grid
- `src/content/timeline.js` — timeline entries
- `src/content/posterSeries.js` — poster series captions
- `src/content/p50.js` — P50 image sets (pairs, blanks, outdoor)

View-specific copy still lives in:

- `src/views/HomeView.jsx`
- `src/views/AboutView.jsx`
- `src/views/ContactView.jsx`
- `src/components/ProjectModal.jsx`
